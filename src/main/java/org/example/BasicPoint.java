//        2. Design a class for a basic point in 2D space. The class should have the following features:
//        - Instance variables for the x and y coordinates of the point.
//        - A constructor that allows the user to create a point with given x and y coordinates.
//        - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a point with the same x and y coordinates, and false otherwise.
//        - A clone method that creates and returns a new point with the same x and y coordinates as the original point.
